    <about> I am a non traditional student well rooted in sciences such as physics, chemistry and mathematics.I have been studying
            to attain my degree in mechanical engineering for a few years while working a part time job. My interest in computers
            has always played a role in my life and mechanical engineering was not the vehicle taking me where i wanted to go. 
            When i was 12 years old i remember making a primitive website and surfing on America OnLine. I have an appetite to learn
            the best ways to be effective in the workforce. I believe prime is a an optimal way to achieve those skills.
