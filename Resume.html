      <p2>
   
              I am a non traditional college student well rooted in sciences such as physics, chemistry and mathematics.I have been studying
            to attain my degree in mechanical engineering for while working a part time job. My interest in computers
            has always played a role in my life. When i was 12 years old i remember making a primitive website for the rock band that
            i was in. The world of code has always fascinated me. When i heard about prime i had realized it was something i was interested in.
            I have an appetite to learn the best ways to be effective in the workforce. I believe prime is a an optimal way to achieve those 
            skills.
